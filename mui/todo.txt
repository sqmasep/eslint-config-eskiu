Should list all the dom elements that can be replaced by MUI components.
https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/HEAD/docs/rules/forbid-elements.md

"react/forbid-elements": [<enabled>, { "forbid": [<string|object>] }]

object = {
    element: "button",
    message: "some error msg"
}

why not write a function so it's like:
const err = (domElement, shouldBeReplacedWith) => {
    return {
        element: domElement,
        message: `Use MUI's ${shouldBeReplacedWith} instead. ${domElement} is forbidden`
    }
}

actually that may be a problem tbh. Since <div> could be either a box, grid, or stack or whatever. But could be interesting to list them all idk
same with <button>, there is also <IconButton>
